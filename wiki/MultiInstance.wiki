= Starcraft =

After installing BWAPI, navigate to  _`Starcraft/bwapi-data/`_ and run _`Multiple Instance Hack.bat`_.

  http://bwapi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/multi_tut_00.gif

The batch file will proceed to run an included patch file and create a new executable called _`StarCraft_MultiInstance.exe`_ in your Starcraft folder.

_*NOTE: We intend to automate this process in the future.*_


= Chaos Launcher =

After installing BWAPI, navigate to the _`BWAPI/Chaoslauncher`_ directory and run _`Chaoslauncher - MultiInstance.exe`_.

  http://bwapi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/multi_tut_01.gif

There is a drop-down menu that allows you to select the version you want to use. Click on it and select _`Starcraft Multi-Instance`_.

Select _`BWAPI Injector`_ and any other plugins you wish to use.

  http://bwapi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/multi_tut_03.gif

Some plugins will be greyed out. Don't worry, this is normal behaviour. There is a checkbox available that will enable them.

= BWAPI =

To set up BWAPI for multiple instances, you must configure the AI path for each instance. Browse to _`Starcraft/bwapi-data/`_ and open _`bwapi.ini`_.

  http://bwapi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/multi_tut_05.gif

Now change the _`ai`_ entry to contain comma-separated paths to the AI modules you wish to use.

  http://bwapi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/multi_tut_06.gif

Each comma-separated entry will be loaded for their respective instance (first instance loads the first entry, etc). If there are more instances than entries, then the last entry is used for all subsequent instances.


= Networking =

After installing BWAPI, a new network mode called *Local PC* should now be available after choosing Multiplayer.

    _*Note*: *This network mode will only appear when BWAPI has been [Injection injected]* and will allow you to play matches between multiple instances.
